## Chapter 5: Classes and Modules

In this chapter, we explore the use of classes in JavaScript, showcasing how to create and extend classes using inheritance. The chapter includes the following key topics:

1. **[Modules with Imports and Exports](Chapter-5/1-Modules-With-Imports-And-Exports):** Understanding how to structure code using modules for better organization and maintainability.
2. **[Module Objects](Chapter-5/5-Classes/cookie.js):** Exploring the properties and methods associated with module objects.
3. **Modules Loaded from Remote Sources:**
   - **[Static Imports](Chapter-5/3-Modules-Loaded-From-Remote-Sources/Dynamic-Imports/importOnInteraction_lodash.html):** Using static import statements to include modules.
   - **Dynamic Imports:**
     - **[Import on Interaction](Chapter-5/3-Modules-Loaded-From-Remote-Sources/Dynamic-Imports/importOnInteraction_lodash.html):** Loading modules dynamically based on user interactions.
     - **[Import on Visibility](Chapter-5/3-Modules-Loaded-From-Remote-Sources/Dynamic-Imports/importOnVisibility.html):** Using the Intersection Observer API to load modules when they come into view.
4. **[Modules for the Server](Chapter-5/4-Modules-For-The-Server/package.json):** Discussing how to configure and use modules in a server environment.
5. **[Classes with Constructors, Getters, and Setters](Chapter-5/5-Classes/cake.js):** Implementing classes with constructors and utilizing getters and setters for encapsulation.

This chapter emphasizes the importance of modular design and the benefits of using classes to encapsulate functionality in JavaScript applications.
